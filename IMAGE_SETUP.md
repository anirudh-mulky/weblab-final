# Product Images Setup

## Image Files Required

Please add the following image files to the `/frontend/images/` directory:

1. **ecopower-400w.jpg** - EcoPower 400W (Residential)
   - Image showing portable solar panel with "EcoPower 400W" and "UltraCell 400W" labels

2. **sunmax-450w.jpg** - SunMax 450W (High Efficiency)
   - Image showing solar panel on rooftop with "UltraCell" and "SunMax 450W" labels

3. **solarpro-500w.jpg** - SolarPro 500W (Commercial)
   - Aerial view of two solar panels with "UltraCell®" and "SolarPro 500W" labels

4. **ultracell-550w.jpg** - UltraCell 550W (Premium)
   - Aerial view of village with solar panels, showing "UltraCell 550W" label

## Image Order in Products

The images appear in this order:
1. EcoPower 400W
2. SunMax 450W
3. SolarPro 500W
4. UltraCell 550W

## How It Works

- Product cards will display the images when available
- If an image fails to load, the fallback emoji will display
- Cart items will also show the product images
- Product detail pages show the full-size image

## Supported Formats

- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP

All functionality remains unchanged - only the visual display uses images instead of emojis.
